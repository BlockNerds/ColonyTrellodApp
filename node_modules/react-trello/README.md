## Features

![alt tag](https://github.com/rcdexta/react-trello/raw/master/react-trello.gif)

* responsive and extensible
* easily pluggable into existing application
* supports pagination when scrolling individual lanes
* drag-and-drop within and across lanes (compatible with touch devices)
* event bus for triggering events externally (e.g.: adding or removing cards based on events coming from backend)
* edit functionality to add/delete cards

## Getting Started

```
npm install --save react-trello
```

## Usage

The `Board` component takes a prop called `data` that contains all the details related to rendering the board. A sample data json is given here to illustrate the contract:

```javascript
const data = {
  lanes: [
    {
      id: 'lane1',
      title: 'Planned Tasks',
      label: '2/2',
      cards: [
        {id: 'Card1', title: 'Write Blog', description: 'Can AI make memes', label: '30 mins'},
	    {id: 'Card2', title: 'Pay Rent', description: 'Transfer via NEFT', label: '5 mins', metadata: {sha: 'be312a1'}}
      ]
    },
    {
      id: 'lane2',
      title: 'Completed',
      label: '0/0',
      cards: []
    }
  ]
}
```

The data is fed to the board component and that's it.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Board from 'react-trello'

export default class App extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return  <Board data={data} />
	}
}
```

### Board

This is the container component that encapsulates the lanes and cards

| Name                  | Type     | Description                              |

| tagStyle              | object   | If cards have tags, use this prop to modify their style |

Refer to `stories` folder for examples on many more options for customization.

### Publish Events

When defining the board, it is possible to obtain a event hook to the component to publish new events later after the board has been rendered. Refer the example below:

```javascript
let eventBus = undefined

const setEventBus = (handle) => {
  eventBus = handle
}
//To add a card
eventBus.publish({type: 'ADD_CARD', laneId: 'COMPLETED', card: {id: "M1", title: "Buy Milk", label: "15 mins", description: "Also set reminder"}})

//To remove a card
eventBus.publish({type: 'REMOVE_CARD', laneId: 'PLANNED', cardId: "M1"})

//To move a card from one lane to another. index specifies the position to move the card to in the target lane
eventBus.publish({type: 'MOVE_CARD', fromLaneId: 'PLANNED', toLaneId: 'WIP', cardId: 'Plan3', index: 0})

<Board data={data} eventBusHandle={setEventBus}/>
```

The first event in the above example will move the card `Buy Milk` from the planned lane to completed lane. We expect that this library can be wired to a backend push api that can alter the state of the board in realtime.

### Custom Card Styling

You can completely customize the look-and-feel of each card in any lane by passing in a custom component as child to the Board as seen below:

```javascript
<Board data={data} customCardLayout>
      <CustomCard />
</Board>
```

`customCardLayout` prop must be set to true for the custom card to be rendered

The json content for the card and the card template must agree on the props:

```javascript
const CustomCard = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header
        style={{borderBottom: '1px solid #eee', paddingBottom: 6, marginBottom: 10,
    		 display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'space-between',
			color: props.cardColor
        }}
      >
        <div style={{ fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{props.name}</div>
        <div style={{ fontSize: 11 }}>{props.dueOn}</div>
      </header>
      <div style={{ fontSize: 12, color: '#BD3B36' }}>
        <div style={{ color: '#4C4C4C', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{props.subTitle}</div>
        <div style={{ padding: '5px 0px' }}><i>{props.body}</i></div>
        <div style={{ marginTop: 10, textAlign: 'center', color: props.cardColor, fontSize: 15, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
          {props.escalationText}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

const data = {
    lanes: [
      {
        id: 'lane1',
        title: 'Planned Tasks',
        cards: [
          {
            id: 'Card1',
            name: 'John Smith',
            dueOn: 'due in a day',
            subTitle: 'SMS received at 12:13pm today',
            body: 'Thanks. Please schedule me for an estimate on Monday.',
            escalationText: 'Escalated to OPS-ESCALATIONS!',
            cardColor: '#BD3B36',
            cardStyle: { borderRadius: 6, boxShadow: '0 0 6px 1px #BD3B36', marginBottom: 15 }
          },
          {
            id: 'Card2',
            name: 'Card Weathers',
            dueOn: 'due now',
            subTitle: 'Email received at 1:14pm',
            body: 'Is the estimate free, and can someone call me soon?',
            escalationText: 'Escalated to Admin',
            cardColor: '#E08521',
            cardStyle: { borderRadius: 6, boxShadow: '0 0 6px 1px #E08521', marginBottom: 15 }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Editable Board

It is possible to make the entire board editable by setting the `editable` prop to true. This switch prop will enable existing cards to be deleted and show a `Add Card` link at the bottom of each lane, clicking which will show an inline editable new card.

Check out the [editable board story](https://rcdexta.github.io/react-trello/?selectedKind=Editable%20Board&selectedStory=Add%2FDelete%20Cards&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0) and its corresponding [source code](https://github.com/rcdexta/react-trello/blob/master/stories/EditableBoard.story.js) for more details.

## Feature Wishlist

* Making the board fully editable. Currently, the library supports adding new cards to a lane and deleting existing cards. The ability to add new lanes to the end should be possible
* Rewrite the drag-n-drop functionality to support moving cards to a specific position within a lane or to a different lane. Ability to re-arrange lanes
* the prop `onDataChange` is a catch all callback that returns the entire board data when anything changes on the board. Micro-events like when a card is added or re-arranged should be possible too

Check the Milestones for this project to track when the above features will be implemented.
